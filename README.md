## üßê About
Although I might spend 24 hours sitting at a desk working on the next mod, or my next game, I definatly spend more time working
on mods then I do my own projects. I have been a web designer and builder for 7 years and got into game design 3 years ago. I work 
mostly in Unity and Unreal but I have used projects like Godot before.

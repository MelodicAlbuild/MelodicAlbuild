## 🧐 About
I spend my time chronically programming on one project or another. I have had my share of experiences in C#, espeically with Unity, but I've gotten closer to .NET Core and WPF in the last couple months. It's always an adventure to find a new way to approach a project, which has turned my dream video game from Altrix to Project Oblivion to now Luminary and Starforge. I love iteration and the constant growth and change over time.

## What am I up to?
I've taken a hiatus from other games and am dedicating my time to Hytale!
